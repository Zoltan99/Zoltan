Hello!
I have written a hardcoded python program, to download the large courses videofiles one by one.

Important! The code written without error handling.

**Updated: the program checks the downloaded video files in the folder and wont download it again.**

How to use it:

1. Run Skill-Share-Crawler---DL script.
https://github.com/tharyckgusmao/Skill-Share-Crawler---DL/blob/master/README.md
Follow the steps.

2. Choose the classes by the console or insert a specific id found in the video URL. Press enter.
The script created all the important files.

3. Wait 10s, and press ctrl+c to exit the program. 

4. navigate in terminal (on win commandline) to letolto.py folder.

5. start on linux with: **python3 letolto.py** (if you have python3 not instaled, install it), on windows: **python letolto.py**

6. the program ask the video files absolute path, paste the Skill-Share-Crawler created folder path, like this:(/home/z-home/Skill-Share-Crawler---DL-master/videos/Blender 28 complete course master all the basics of Blender/)
hit enter

7. than ask the destination folder absolute path, choose a writeable folder on your pc, paste the path, like this: (/media/z-home/hdd1/video/large_course/)
hit enter, the program download all files one by one and rename it with ordinal number too.

That's it.

Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 and Windows 7 64.
