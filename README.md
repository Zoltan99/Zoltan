Hello!
I have written a hardcoded python program, to download the large courses videofiles one by one.
Important! The code written without error handling.
How to use it:

1. Run Skill-Share-Crawler---DL script.
https://github.com/tharyckgusmao/Skill-Share-Crawler---DL/blob/master/README.md
2. Choose the classes by the console or insert a specific id found in the video URL. Press enter.
The script created all the important files.
3. Wait 10s, and press ctrl+c to exit the program. 
4 navigate in terminal (on win commandline) to letolto.py folder.
5. start with python3 letolto.py (if you have python3 not instaled, install it)
6.the program ask first the video files absolte path (/home/z-home/Skill-Share-Crawler---DL-master/videos/Blender 28 complete course master all the basics of Blender/)
hit enter
7.than ask the destination folder absolute path choose a writeable folder on your pc (/media/z-home/hdd1/video/large_course/)
hit enter, the program download all files one by one and rename it with ordinal number.

Thats it.
