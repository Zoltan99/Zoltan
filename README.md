Hello!
I have written a hardcoded python program, to download the large courses videofiles one by one.
Important! The code written without error handling.
How to use it:

1. Run Skill-Share-Crawler---DL script.
https://github.com/tharyckgusmao/Skill-Share-Crawler---DL/blob/master/README.md

2. Choose the classes by the console or insert a specific id found in the video URL. Press enter.
The script created all the important files.

3. Wait 10s, and press ctrl+c to exit the program. 

4 navigate in terminal (on win commandline) to letolto.py folder.

5. start with python3 letolto.py (if you have python3 not instaled, install it)

6.the program ask the video files absolte path (/home/z-home/Skill-Share-Crawler---DL-master/videos/Blender 28 complete course master all the basics of Blender/)
hit enter

7.than ask the destination folder absolute path choose a writeable folder on your pc (/media/z-home/hdd1/video/large_course/)
hit enter, the program download all files one by one and rename it with ordinal number.

Thats it.
